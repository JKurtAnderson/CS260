          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>Hello. My name is Justin. When I was a wee lad, I got a present
            from my late father. He had sent me a camera from beyond the grave.
            Well, actually he had sent it to me before he died, but you know
            what I mean. When I received that camera, I knew that my whole life
            would never be the same. My first photo was of my cat. My cat died
            the next day, but my mother told me that he was in a better place
            because he was away from me. That day I swore to make the world a
            better place with my newfound camera, for Fluffy. I took photos of
            everything. But sometimes, things didn't like my photos. I got beat
            up a lot as a child. Then my mother abandoned me at soccer practice.
            I spent the rest of high school sleeping on a bench in a park and
            showering in the school gym, taking photos of everything.</p>

          <h2>The Birth of a Hobo</h2>
          <p>The day I dropped out of high school was the best day of my life.
            My talent was being wasted at that establishment and I knew it.
            I could then do whatever I wanted. I moved to Los Angeles and lived
            in a tent. It was like a forever camping trip! Unfortunately, I
            didn't have access to a shower anymore, so I smelled bad. Luckilly,
            I found some unused Axe bodyspray and applied it to my body. I didn't
            smell bad anymore after that. After a couple of years of that
            lifestyle, I thought that I could sell my talents for money. I
            would stop people in the street and offer to take their picture
            and then threatening to burp on them if they didn't pay me for it.
            Now I can afford a place to live and a shower. But I like my tent
            and my neighbors are super friendly, so I just burn all the money I
            get.</p>
